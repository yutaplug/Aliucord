"How to get modern UI/interface?"
This is not really possible due to Aliucord using an old Discord version, however, you can install "DiscordRN Dark" theme from #themes channel or use Kettu/Rain clients.

"How to install Aliucord/plugins/themes?"
<https://yutaplug.github.io/Aliucord/#beginner-guide>

"Is there x plugin?"
Search for it using the `!plugins` command in #bot-spam, PluginWeb plugin or using the built-in Discord searchbar. If you can't find it, stand by until a supporter can assist you.

"Can I get nitro?"
Real nitro is not possible, but you can get plugins that mimic a few nitro features (use the `!fakenitro` command).

"Where can I find the changelog?"
<https://yutaplug.github.io/Aliucord/#changelog>

"Is there a plugin to bypass file size?"
No, best you can do is uploading the file to <https://catbox.moe> or a similar service.

"How to fix message links opening in Discord?"
Install https://github.com/yutaplug/Aliucord/raw/builds/OpenLinksInApp.zip plugin

"I can't login because of 2FA"
You probably have security keys, check if you do using the official Discord app/browser, and remove them (you can re-add them later).

"I can't login with token"
Make sure the token is still valid and that it doesn't contain any white spaces.

"PlayableEmbeds not working"
Install https://github.com/yutaplug/Aliucord/raw/builds/Fluff.zip instead.

"Why does Aliucord use an old Discord version?"
<https://yutaplug.github.io/Aliucord/#old-version>

"Theme is not working"
Read #theme-support pins for fixed versions of old themes and make sure you are using the right transparency.

"How to add a custom font or background?"
<https://yutaplug.github.io/Aliucord/#themer>

"Will using Aliucord get me banned?"
Client modifications are against Discord's Terms of Service. However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods. So you should generally be fine as long as you don't use plugins that bypass api restrictions or implement spammy / selfbot behaviour (mass deleting, spam plugins, "animated" custom status, etc).

"I have issues with the manager (I can't install Aliucord)"
Read #common-issues channel or stand by until a supporter can assist you.
