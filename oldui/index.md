# Reasons of why Aliucord uses an old Discord version

- The new Discord mobile client uses the React Native framework, which is not as performant as Kotlin. React Native is a port from iOS while Kotlin is Android native.

- Even if we'd want to use the new one, everything would need to be rewriten and thats a waste of time considering how bad React Native is.

- Aliucord developers don't & [didn't](https://github.com/Aliucord/AliucordRN) like to work with the new one.

- If Aliucord didn't exist, there wouldn't be any client using the good old 126.21 version, which is the last version of Discord that uses Kotlin (except [Bluecord](https://bluesmods.com/bluecord) which we do not recommend using as the creator has a [very bad reputation and past](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y2m2lMSpN3GlOcXyceaO88Ljnr8xuNcp), use at your own risk).

- Features from the new Discord can be [backported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backporting) to the old one, [and theres already a ton](/Aliucord/backports)!

- Modified clients for new Discord versions already exist, you can find them [here](https://github.com/Discord-Client-Encyclopedia-Management/Discord3rdparties).
