# Beginner

You can install Aliucord [here](https://github.com/Aliucord/Manager/releases/download/v1.2.1/aliucord-manager-v1.2.1.apk).

## How to install plugins

1. Join the [Aliucord Discord server](https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU)
2. Make sure you are using the Aliucord app
3. Go to [#plugins-list](https://discord.com/channels/811255666990907402/811275162715553823) or [#new-plugins](https://discord.com/channels/811255666990907402/845784407846813696) channels and hold any message or link
4. Click on "View [Author]'s Plugins" (for #new-plugins, if you hold message or link you can directly install the plugin you want by pressing "Install [Plugin name]")
5. Install the plugin you want

**Notes:**
- Most plugins need an app restart to work properly.
- The PluginWeb plugin is recommended if you want a built-in plugin list.

## How to install themes

1. Join the [Aliucord Discord server](https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU)
2. Make sure you are using the Aliucord app
3. Install the [Themer plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vendicated/AliucordPlugins/builds/Themer.zip) (move the .zip to `Aliucord/plugins` folder & restart app)
4. Go to [#themes](https://discord.com/channels/811255666990907402/824357609778708580) channel and hold any message (NOT THE LINK)
5. Click on the first option ("Install [Theme name]")

**Notes:**
- After installing a theme you should go to Themer settings to enable it.
- Themes require an app restart to work properly.

## How to install plugins manually

Required for [#unmaintained-plugins](https://discord.com/channels/811255666990907402/861935147272110100) channel

**Note:**
If you already have the plugin .zip, just follow two last steps.

1. Go to any plugin repository ([like this one](https://github.com/Juby210/Aliucord-plugins))
2. Click the branch button and select `builds`
3. Click the `[PluginName].zip` of the plugin you want
4. Click `Raw`, `View raw` or the download button to download the .zip file
5. Using a file manager ([we recommend Material Files](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files) ([F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/me.zhanghai.android.files/))) move the downloaded `.zip` to the `Aliucord/plugins` folder

# New interface

This is not really possible due to Aliucord using an old Discord version. However, there are two themes ([DiscordRN Dark](https://discord.com/channels/811255666990907402/824357609778708580/1396601756187885659) & [Discord Midnight theme](https://discord.com/channels/811255666990907402/824357609778708580/1400698799600570398)) that replicate the color & font of it (the UI itself is not possible to replicate).

Alternatively, you can search for another modified Discord client that uses the new version instead of the old one [here](https://github.com/Discord-Client-Encyclopedia-Management/Discord3rdparties).

---

# Old version

**Reasons of why Aliucord uses an old Discord version**

- The new Discord app is React Native while the Discord version that Aliucord uses (126.21) is Kotlin. React Native is a framework for building apps using JavaScript, which is not as performant as Kotlin code. Discord's React Native version is known to have performance issues, especially on lower-end devices, because the app has been ported from iOS over to Android.

- Everything would need to be rewritten, wasting time, considering how bad the new Discord version is.

- Aliucord developers don't like to work with the new one. [Notice from the AliucordRN repository](https://github.com/Aliucord/AliucordRN#-notice-)

- If Aliucord ceases to exist, there wouldn't be any active clients using the good old Discord version. [Bluecord situation](https://github.com/Discord-Client-Encyclopedia-Management/Discord3rdparties#user-content-fn-8-9830c9da557f0042dfc833eae2becd36)

- Features from new Discord versions can be backported to the old one. [What does backporting mean?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backporting)

- Modded clients for the new Discord version already exist, such as [Kettu](https://www.raincord.dev/kettu) or [Shiggycord](https://shiggycord.dev).

# Sounds

**How to use CustomSounds, StartupSound and NoticeSound plugins**

**GitHub:**
  - Create a GitHub account
  - Create a repo (make sure it's public)
  - Click add file and upload the sound
  - Once uploaded, click its name
  - Hold `View raw` and copy the address
  - Paste the link into the plugin

**Locally:**
  - Install [this file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files) & open it (or any file manager that lets you copy file paths)
  - Find the sound file
  - Click the 3 dots next to it & press `Copy Path`
  - Go to the plugin settings & paste it
  - Add `file://` at the start

Final result should be `file:///storage/emulated/0/Example/Example.mp3`

# Themer

**Note:** Reading the [Documentation](https://github.com/Aliucord/documentation/blob/main/theme-dev) and using the [Theme maker site](https://aliucord.com/theme-maker) can help you make your own theme.

## How to set a custom background

First of all, you need to enable transparency in Themer settings (chat, chat & settings). If you want full transparency, you need to use the [template](#how-to-make-the-background-work-with-full-transparency).

**GitHub:**
  - Create a GitHub account
  - Create a repo (make sure it's public)
  - Click `Add file` and upload the image/gif
  - Once uploaded, click its name
  - Hold the image and copy the address
  - Go to Themer settings → your theme → `Background` & paste it

**Locally:**
  - Install [this file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files) & open it (or any file manager that lets you copy file paths)
  - Find the image/gif file
  - Click the 3 dots next to it & press `Copy path`
  - Go to Themer settings → your theme → `Background` & paste it
  - Add `file:/` at the start

Final result should be `file://storage/emulated/0/Example/Example.jpg`

## How to set a custom font

First of all, you need to enable the `Enable Custom Fonts` option in Themer settings.

**GitHub:**
  - Create a GitHub account
  - Create a repo (make sure it's public)
  - Click `Add file` and upload the font
  - Once uploaded, click its name
  - Hold `View raw` and copy the address
  - Go to Themer settings → your theme → `Fonts` & paste it where the asterisk is

**Note:** If the font you want is already uploaded in some repo, you can just copy the raw link, no need to make your own repo.

**Locally:**
  - Install [this file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files) & open it (or any file manager that lets you copy file paths)
  - Find the font file
  - Click the 3 dots next to it & press `Copy path`
  - Go to Themer settings → your theme → `Fonts` & paste it where the asterisk is
  - Add `file:/` at the start

Final result should be `file://storage/emulated/0/Example/Example.ttf`

## Why does my background image not work

- You didn't enable transparency
- You enabled full transparency which doesn't work without the template
- You are using `cdn.discordapp.com` or `media.discordapp.net` which don't work as a valid URL anymore
- The URL is incorrect

## How to make the background work with full transparency

- Open the [template](https://github.com/OasisVee/theme-templates/blob/main/full-transparency-background-template.json)
- Press the 3 dots and download
- Move the downloaded `.json` to your `Aliucord/themes` folder using a file manager & restart Aliucord if it was open
- Go to Themer settings, enable full transparency & enable the theme
- Go inside the theme settings → `Background` & paste the image/gif url
- Press back, press the save button & restart Aliucord
