# How to use StartupSound, NoticeSound & CustomSounds plugins

- GitHub:
  - Create a GitHub account
  - Create a repo (make sure its public)
  - Click add file and upload the sound
  - Once uploaded, click its name
  - Hold `View raw` and copy the address
  - Paste the link(s) into the plugin

- Locally:
  - Install [this file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files) & open it (or any file manager that lets you copy file paths)
  - Find the sound file
  - Click the 3 dots next to it & press `Copy Path`
  - Go to the plugin settings & paste it
  - Add `file://` at the start

Final result should be `file:///storage/emulated/0/Example/Example.mp3`
