# Why does Aliucord use an old Discord version?

1. React Native is very slow compared to Kotlin. RN is a framework for building apps using JavaScript, which is not as performant as Kotlin code. Discord's React Native version is known to have performance issues, especially on lower-end devices, because the app has been ported from iOS over to Android.

2. Everything would need to be rewritten, wasting time, considering how bad the new Discord version is.

3. Aliucord developers don't like to work with the new one. [Notice from the AliucordRN repository](https://github.com/Aliucord/AliucordRN#-notice-)

4. If Aliucord ceases to exist, there wouldn't be any active clients using the good old Discord version.

:::warning Bluecord
Bluecord is also a modded client for the old version of Discord, but the main developer is not a good person, so we don't recommend using it.

5. Features from new Discord versions can be backported to the old one.

6. Modded clients for the new Discord version already exist, such as [Kettu](https://www.raincord.dev/kettu) or [Shiggycord](https://shiggycord.dev).
