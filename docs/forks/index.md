# Plugin forks

- AudioPlayer fork by Halkion fixes crashes and some bugs with audio files.

- Waifuim, NekosLife forks by Serinova fix the commands being fully broken. Additionally, Serinova made a plugin called AnimeImageFetch containing NSFW since NekosLife doesnt contain NSFW anymore.

- CheckLinks fork by Serinova fixes the majority of the urls not being checked (VirusTotal changed its link structure).

- NitroSpoof fork by Kiwi makes the fake emojis look real just like on Vencord's FakeNitro plugin or Vendetta's (and their forks) Realmoji plugin. Also fixes a scrolling bug in emoji picker.

- FakeStickers fork by Archimedes (renamed to BetterFakeStickers) fixes not being able to reply with stickers.

- Ip fork by Serinova fixes the `/ip` command.

- SendEmbeds fork by Serinova makes the `/embed` command work again by using directwebhook (original API died).

- PersistSettings fork by Archimedes makes the plugin work again in 126.21 version.
