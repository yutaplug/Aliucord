# How to make Aliucord look like modern Discord

This is not really possible due to Aliucord using an old Discord version. However, there are two themes ([DiscordRN Dark](https://discord.com/channels/811255666990907402/824357609778708580/1396601756187885659) & [Discord Midnight theme](https://discord.com/channels/811255666990907402/824357609778708580/1400698799600570398)) that replicate the color & font of it (the UI itself is not possible to replicate).

Alternatively, you can search for another modified Discord client that uses the new version instead of the old one [here](https://github.com/Discord-Client-Encyclopedia-Management/Discord3rdparties) ([Kettu](https://github.com/C0C0B01/KettuManager/releases/latest/download/Manager.apk) is recommended).
