# Aliucord plugin searching guide

Don't ask where a plugin is, find it by yourself!

On Aliucord server, open the searchbar (🔍︎ icon at the topbar right corner), now type `in:#plugins-list in:#new-plugins in:#unmaintained-plugins PluginNameHere` and replace `PluginNameHere` with the plugin name. Per example, if you want MessageLogger, replace it with `MessageLogger`. Almost every plugin is published with no spaces so you need to type it this exact way. If the `in:` parameter doesn't work and still gives results for all channels, you have your Aliucord in another language that is not english, in this case, change it to english or type `in:` but in your language.

Alternatively, if you still can't find it, you can search `PluginNameHere.zip` to (probably) find a message containing the raw link of the desired plugin. If it's sent by a trusted member, you can install it by holding the message (NOT THE LINK) (trusted members are people with support-helper or plugin-developer roles). In [#plugin-development](https://discord.com/channels/811255666990907402/811261478875299840) channel, every plugin can be installed by holding the message no matter the user.

**Note:** Installing plugins by holding a message in [#unmaintained-plugins](https://discord.com/channels/811255666990907402/861935147272110100) channel is not allowed, you will need to read the [#unmaintained-plugins installation guide](https://yutaplug.github.io/Aliucord/beginner/#how-to-install-a-plugin-manually-required-for-unmaintained-plugins-channel).

## Built-in Plugin Browser

There's also a PluginWeb plugin which you can use to easily find & install plugins through your Aliucord settings.

Installation: Click [this](https://github.com/RazerTexz/My-plugins/raw/builds/PluginWeb.zip), now move the downloaded .zip to the `Aliucord/plugins` folder & restart Aliucord if it was open.

Usage: Open settings, you will find a `Open Plugin Web` button at the bottom (`ALIUCORD` section), now just simply click it and try searching for the plugin you want!
