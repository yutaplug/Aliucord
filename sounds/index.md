# How to use StartupSound, NoticeSound & CustomSounds plugins
GitHub:
- Create a github account 
- Create a repo (make sure its public)
- Click add file and upload the sound
- Once uploaded, click its name
- Hold `View raw` and copy the address
- Paste the link(s) into the plugin

Locally:
- Install [this file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files) & open it (or any file manager that lets you copy file paths)
- Find the sound file
- Click the 3 dots next to it & press `Copy Path`
- Go to the plugin settings & paste it
- Add `file://` at the start
 
Final result should be `file:///storage/emulated/0/Example/Example.mp3`
