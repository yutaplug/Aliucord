# How to get the New UI of Discord on Aliucord?
**YOU HAVE BEEN CLICKBAITED!**

Jokes aside, this is not possible due to Aliucord using an old Discord version. However, there is a theme that replicates the color of it (the UI itself is not possible to replicate). [This is how you can install it](https://streamable.com/r25l7t).

Alternatively, you can search for another modified Discord client that uses the new version instead of the old one [here](https://github.com/Discord-Client-Encyclopedia-Management/Discord3rdparties).
