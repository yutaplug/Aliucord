# Temporary workaround for VC on Aliucord
- Download [this .zip](https://nightly.link/omardotdev/aliucar/workflows/build/feat%2Fvc/build.zip?status=completed)
- Extract it and find `Aliucord.zip` inside it
- Move `Aliucord.zip` to your `Aliucord` folder ([video tutorial](https://streamable.com/dj705w))
- Open Aliucord settings
- Enable [Developer Mode](https://files.catbox.moe/10707n.jpg) & [Aliucord from storage](https://files.catbox.moe/lruiyx.jpg) ([video tutorial](https://streamable.com/pxcs34))
- Restart Aliucord

# Notes
- This is a temporary fix of another temporary fix that hasnt been merged in core yet ([Pull #647](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord/pull/647))
- Once the fix gets officially merged, you can stop using this custom `Aliucord.zip`
- This fix will most likely stop working on `March 1, 2026`, the date on which Discord will force the new E2EE
